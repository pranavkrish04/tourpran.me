  <p>Hey guys, this is a pretty awesome challenge !! Here we will be writing assembly and then we will give it to the program(binary)</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution:</h3>

<p>First I check the mitigations :</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/pwnabletw2/pwnable2.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>We have NX disabled. That means it is something to do with the shellcode.</li>
  <li>Seems like there is a canary which will not allow you to do a stack based buffer overflows.</li>
  <li>there is no pie so the address of the binary will be same every time you run.</li>
</ul>

<p>Letâ€™s see the disassembly of this program
<img src="/assets/images/pwnabletw2/pwnable.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here we can see that our input is being put in the address <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x804a060</code> and then it is moved to EAX and then after that EAX is called.
Meaning: our input is being executed. Now, let us run the binary and see what is happening :&gt;</p>
